Set of simulation files:

(1) Set of functions 
    For both simulations, user input can change the environment of the agent (e.g., momentum, stable, random volatility, etc.)
    as well as how many bandits are in the task.
    (a) simulate standard RL agents
    (b) simulate moody RL agents
    
    
(2) Generate simulated agents using functions defined in (1)
